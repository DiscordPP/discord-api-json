      "Permissions are a way to limit and grant certain abilities to users in Discord. A set of base permissions can be configured at the guild level for different roles. When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the guild-level permissions, Discord also supports permission overwrites that can be assigned to individual roles or members on a per-channel basis.",

      "Permissions are stored in a variable-length integer serialized into a string, and are calculated using bitwise operations. For example, the permission value 123 will be serialized as \"123\". For long-term stability, it's recommended to deserialize the permissions using your preferred languages' Big Integer libraries. The total permissions integer can be determined by OR-ing (|) together each individual value, and flags can be checked using AND (&) operations.",

During the remaining lifetime of API v6, all new permission bits will only be introduced in permissions_new, allow_new, and deny_new. These _new fields are just for response serialization; requests with these fields should continue to use the original permissions, allow, and deny fields, which accept both string or number values.",

          "Permissions with regards to categories and channels within categories are a bit tricky. Rather than inheritance, permissions are calculated by means of what we call Permission Syncing. If a child channel has the same permissions and overwrites (or lack thereof) as its parent category, the channel is considered \"synced\" to the category. Any further changes to a parent category will be reflected in its synced child channels. Any further changes to a child channel will cause it to become de-synced from its parent category, and its permissions will no longer change with changes to its parent category.",
