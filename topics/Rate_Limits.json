      "Rate limits exist across Discord's APIs to prevent spam, abuse, and service overload. Limits are applied to individual bots and users both on a per-route basis and globally. Individuals are determined using a request's authentication\u2014for example, a bot token for a bot.",
      "> info\n> Because rate limits depend on a variety of factors and are subject to change, rate limits should not be hard coded into your app. Instead, your app should parse response headers to prevent hitting the limit, and to respond accordingly in case you do.",
      "Per-route rate limits exist for many individual endpoints, and may include the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE). In some cases, per-route limits will be shared across a set of similar endpoints, indicated in the X-RateLimit-Bucket header. It's recommended to use this header as a unique identifier for a rate limit, which will allow you to group shared limits as you encounter them.",
      "During calculation, per-route rate limits often account for top-level resources within the path using an identifier\u2014for example, guild_id when calling /guilds/{guild.id}/channels. Top-level resources are currently limited to channels (channel_id), guilds (guild_id), and webhooks (webhook_id or webhook_id + webhook_token). This means that an endpoint with two different top-level resources may calculate limits independently. As an example, if you exceeded a rate limit when calling one endpoint /channels/1234, you could still call another similar endpoint like /channels/9876 without a problem.",
      "Global rate limits apply to the total number of requests a bot or user makes, independent of any per-route limits. You can read more on global rate limits below.",
      "> warn\n> Routes for controlling emojis do not follow the normal rate limit conventions. These routes are specifically limited on a per-guild basis to prevent abuse. This means that the quota returned by our APIs may be inaccurate, and you may encounter 429s.",
