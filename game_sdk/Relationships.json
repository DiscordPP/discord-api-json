        "Relationships on Discord change often; people start and stop playing games, go online, offline, invisible, or otherwise change state. Therefore, there are some important factors to remember when working with this manager. When you are first getting a list of a user's relationships, before you can Filter(), you need to wait for the OnRefresh callback to fire. This is your indicator that Discord has successfully taken a snapshot of the state of all your relationships at a given moment. Now that you have this snapshot, you can Filter() it to build the list that you want, and then iterate over that list to do whatever your game needs to do. Use this to build your initial social graph for a user.",
        "As relationships change, the OnRelationshipUpdate event will fire. You can use this to update the user's social graph, changing the status of the other Discord users that you chose to filter, e.g. someone is now online, or now playing the game, or no longer playing.",
